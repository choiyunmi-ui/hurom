				<p class="wsp stx4">Fruits and vegetables are not only abundant in vitamins, minerals, and dietary fiber, but phytochemicals and enzymes as well. According to a 13-year study by University College London, 60,000 people were monitored, and a surprising result was announced: If you eat a daily average of more than seven plates of fruits and vegetables, you could drastically reduce the risk of all-cause mortality. But consuming a sufficient amount of fruits and vegetables is not easy.</p>

				<h4 class="wsp stt4">PHYTONUTRIENTS ARE PLANT NUTRIENTS FOUND ONLY IN FRUITS AND VEGETABLES.</h4>
				<p class="wsp stx7">Similar to the white blood cells we find in the human body, phytonutrients are substances that help plants defend themselves from external dangers, such as insects and microbes. These substances are have powerful antioxidant effects such as anti-aging, skin care, promoting immunity, and much more.</p>
				<p class="wsp stx8">Phytonutrients can have different effects depending on the particular color of the fruit or vegetable. Thus, eating a variety of colors, without heating or cooking the fruit or vegetables, is essential for a balanced nutrient intake conducive to good health.</p>

				<p class="wsp stx10">Enzymes are essential nutrients that help almost all the reactions that occur in our bodies. Even speaking and thinking need the help of enzymes!</p>
				<div class="bgarea v3">
					<img src="img/whyjuice_img09.jpg" width="320" height="464" alt="">
					<div class="blind">
						<strong>1. ENZYMES ARE NECESSARY TO SUSTAIN LIFE.</strong>
						<p>Enzymes are essential to creating energy in your body. If you lack enzymes, materials in your body cannot be broken down into energy, making you more easily fatigued. In contrast, if your body has sufficient enzymes to create energy from ingested food, you can enjoy a vibrant, active life.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<h4 class="wsp stt6">2. THE AMOUNT OF ENZYMES IN OUr BODIES DECREASE AS WE GET OLDER AND MUST BE SUPPLEMENTED THROUGH FOOD.</h4>
				<p class="wsp stx11"> The amount of enzymes in our bodies gradually decreases with age and do not replace themselves. Therefore, they must be supplemented by food. The easiest way to intake the most enzymes is through fruits and vegetables.</p>

						<strong>3. RAW FRUITS AND VEGETABLES CONTAIN THE MOST ENZYMES</strong>
						<p>Enzymes become damaged if they are heated above 40°C. Take an unheated bean and a heated bean. Leave them to germinate, and you will see that the heated bean will not change while the unheated bean will sprout.</p>
						<p>Why? Because there are still active enzymes in the unheated bean. As such, cooked and heated foods already have a reduced amount of enzymes in them. In order to consume active enzymes, we need to eat raw, fresh fruits and vegetables.</p>

				<h3 class="htt"><em class="sp n7">07</em> <strong class="wsp tt7">ALL ABOUT DIETARY FIBER</strong></h3>
				<p class="wsp stx12">Dietary fiber refers to the part of cell walls in fruits, vegetables, and grains that cannot be completely digested. Dietary fiber does not contain energy or calories, however it helps clean as it goes through the digestive system.</p>

						<strong>1. WE DRINK JUICE TO TAKE IN NUTRIENTS SUCH AS VATAMINS, MINERALS, AND PHYTONUTRIENTS</strong>
						<p>Within the three main food contributors to total fiber intake(vegetable, fruit, and cereal), cereal fiber was most strongly associated with a reduced risk of total Ml. (RR, 071; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.91 for each 10-g increase in cereal fiber per day) <span>* Vegetable, Fruit, and Cereal Fiber Intake and Risk of Coronary Heart Disease Men, JAMA. 1996;275(6):447-451></span> One glass of fruit and vegetable smoothies made with a mixer or blender may contain about 1-3g of dietary fiber, while one bowl of rice may contain more than 15g.</p>

				<h4 class="wsp stt7">2. WATER SOLUBLE DIETARY FIBER IN SMOOTHIES ACTUALLY INTERFERES WITH NUTRIENT ABSORPTION</h4>
