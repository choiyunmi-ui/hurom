					PHYTONUTRIENTS
				</h3>
				<p class="stx4">PHYTONUTRIENTS ARE PLANT NUTRIENTS FOUND ONLY<br>IN FRUITS AND VEGETABLES.</p>
				<p class="stx">Similar to the white blood cells we find in the human body, phytonutrients are substances<br>that help plants defend themselves from external dangers, such as insects and microbes.<br>These substances are have powerful antioxidant effects such as anti-aging,<br>skin care, promoting immunity, and much more.</p>
				<p class="stx">Phytonutrients can have different effects depending on the particular color of the fruit or vegetable.<br>Thus, eating a variety of colors, without heating or cooking the fruit or vegetable.<br>is essential for a balanced nutrient intake conducive to good health.</p>

						<h4 class="stt2">1. ENZYMES ARE NECESSARY TO SUSTAIN LIFE.</h4>
						<p class="stx">Enzymes are essential to creating energy in your body. If you lack enzymes, materials<br>in your body cannot be broken down into energy, making you more easily fatigued.<br>In contrast, if your body has sufficient enzymes to create energy from ingested food,<br>you can enjoy a vibrant, active life.</p>
